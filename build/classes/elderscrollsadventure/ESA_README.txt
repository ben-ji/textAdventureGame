Iteration 1 02/27/19: Created basic frame of the game, with a gameWindow, and a series of panels to display buttons, player info, and navigation options.

Plans for future iterations: 
Develop position/location logic so the user can move throughout the game world
Develop story further, with a working battle system and weapon list.
